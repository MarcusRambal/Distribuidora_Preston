        The day I opened up memory's door

        I found something that I could live for

        Curtains shook as you opened my eyes
        And light came rushing inside

        Data behind my heart's encryption key (can you see?)

        Listen and you might hear a melody

        Your fire sparked, the passion that keeps burning

        Magic that helps me to believe

        All the colors of the night and the way they help you hide

        I'm learning what it's like to love and be alive

        Oh, there will always be a tomorrow

        You'll never have to be alone

        Diamond city lights illuminate what's inside

        And all the love I feel by your side

        Decoding these emotions, you're the ocean I wanna dive into tonight

        Rainbow-colored skies invite us to take a ride

        I know time won't wait 'cause it only leaves behind

        Don't cry, look in my eyes and you might find

        A shimmering light that will guide you through the night

        When gray skies take the colors away (far away)

        I'll paint a rainbow lasting for days and days

        Just like the magic that you always shared with me

        Maybe now you need to believe

        As the hands of time progress, it's so easy to forget

        The miracle that helped you bring me to life

        Oh, there will always be a tomorrow

        We'll never have to be alone

        Diamond city lights illuminate what's inside

        And all the love I feel by your side

        Decoding these emotions, you're the ocean I wanna dive into tonight

        Rainbow-colored skies invite us to take a ride

        I know time won't wait 'cause it only leaves behind

        Don't cry, look in my eyes and you might find

        A shimmering light, now let me guide you

        Let's go to the place

        Let's go to the place

        Let's go to the place where our happiness won't fade away

        If you could only see the joy you've showed to me

        I think you would realize everything we could be

        Diamond city lights illuminate what's inside

        And all the love I feel by your side

        Decoding these emotions, you're the ocean I wanna dive into tonight

        Rainbow-colored skies invite us to take a ride

        I know time won't wait 'cause it only leaves behind

        Don't cry, look in my eyes and you might find

        A shimmering light that will guide you through the night

        Diamond lights, rainbow skies

        In the night there's no need to hide

        The joy in your eyes fills me with life, so let it shine</pre>
